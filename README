Configuring Qt Creator
----------------------

For some reason QtCreator 3.4 disables qmlprojects by default, so you have to
go to About Plugins in the menu and enable QmlProjectManager.






On Windows:
-----------

Since Qt Creator is probably installed with it's own Qt libraries (although
not required), and PyQt5 comes with it's own too,  it is necessary to
change the run environment to the "system environment" in the project setting


On OSX:
-------

PyQt5 apperently has issues with OSX, talked about here:
http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/platforms.html#os-x

Can fix this by adding to the project's run environment the variable
DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH pointing to /opt/local/libexec/qt5/lib (when qt5 is
installed via macports)
